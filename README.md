# Sequential seeding in multilayer networks

This repository contains all necessary resources to repeat our research on Sequential seeding in multilayer networks. 
1.	FullNet folder contains ten original networks on which we have evaluated our approach.
2.	ARXIV, AUCS, CKM, Lazega, EUAir, erer, ererer, ererererer, papa, papapa, papapapapa folders contains networks generated during coordinated execution procedure.
3.	Results folder contains results from all experiments, those results are also merged in all_results.txt file
4.	R Code folder contains R scripts used to run experiments.
